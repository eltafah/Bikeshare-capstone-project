SQL Bikeshare Capstone Project
This project is a data analysis of a fictional bikeshare company called Cyclistic using SQL. This case-study is a capstone project of the Google Data Analytics course offered by Coursera. The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights to convert casual riders of Cyclistic into annual members. The project uses a dataset of over 1.5 million rows from the year 2020, which contains information such as member type, ride duration, start and end time, start and end station, and ride distance.

The project consists of the following files:

bikeshare.sql: The main SQL script that contains the queries and calculations for the data analysis.
The project covers the following topics and questions:


Data exploration and summary statistics: How to get an overview of the data and its distribution, such as the number of rides, average duration, most popular stations, etc.
Data aggregation and calculation: How to perform various calculations and aggregations on the data, such as total revenue, average distance, ride frequency, etc.
Data analysis and insights: How to answer the main business question of how to convert casual riders into annual members, based on the data patterns and trends.
The project demonstrates the use of various SQL concepts and techniques, such as:

SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY clauses
JOINs, subqueries, CTEs (common table expressions), temporary tables
Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)
Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)
Date and time functions (DATEPART, DATEADD, DATEDIFF)
String functions (LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTRING)
CASE statements
User-defined functions
The project is intended for anyone who wants to learn or practice SQL skills and apply them to a real-world data analysis scenario. The project assumes some basic knowledge of SQL syntax and logic. The project can be run on any SQL platform that supports the T-SQL dialect (such as Microsoft SQL Server or Azure SQL Database). The project can also be modified or extended to explore other questions or aspects of the bikeshare data.
